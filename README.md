# Hyperbolic.jl

A Julia module for solving 1d non-linear hyperbolic equations.

I have created this code as part of a Phd course in hyperbolic equations in Uppsala University.
This is basically an attempt to learn Julia by solving a concrete problem.
The assignemnts directory contains solutions to some of the assignments in the course and can be though of as an example of how to use the module in case anyone will want to use it for some reason :).
